# Schmallenberg-virus

# Introduction and Discovery

Schmallenberg virus (SBV) emerged as a significant arthropod-borne pathogen in Europe, first identified in November 2011 near the German town of Schmallenberg (North Rhine-Westphalia. The virus was discovered through metagenomic analysis of blood samples from cattle displaying symptoms including fever, reduced milk production, and diarrhea [1,2].


# Spread and Clinical Impact
Following its initial detection, SBV rapidly disseminated across multiple European countries [3]. While adult ruminants typically display mild or subclinical symptoms, the virus can cause severe reproductive complications, including:

Abortions
Stillbirths
Musculoskeletal and Congenital malformations in newborn ruminants [4]


# Genetic Classification
Genetic characterization has classified SBV as a member of the genus Orthobunyavirus within the family Peribunyaviridae (formerly Bunyaviridae).
